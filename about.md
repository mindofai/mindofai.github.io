### Hey!

  </div>
  <div style="display: inline-block; width: 73%; vertical-align: top;">I'm an exuberant software developer, speaker, and open source contributor, with 10+ years experience building applications using the Microsoft technology stack. I specialize in developing cross-platform mobile apps using Xamarin technologies and am a 3-time Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer. <br/><br/>
  I live and work in the bustling center of "Silicon Prairie", Minneapolis MN, where I'm a Sr. Mobile Developer 
  <!--at <a href="https://www.mcomposer.com">Mobile Composer</a> and leading the development on our flagship moible app, Orchestrate.-->

I regularly attend and speak at the [MN Enterprise Mobile](https://www.meetup.com/Minnesota-Enterprise-Mobile) meetup, so if you're in the area I'd highly recommend you check it out.


### Open Source

I wrote the UWP support for these two great drawing libraries that are popular among Xamarin developers:  
 - [NGraphics](https://github.com/praeclarum/NGraphics) - a cross platform library for rendering vector graphics on .NET
 - [NControl](https://github.com/chrfalch/NControl) - a simple Xamarin.Forms wrapper control around the NGraphics library
